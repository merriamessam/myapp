# Containerization and Deployment with Podman, Kubernetes, GitHub, and SonarQube

## Objectives
This guide will walk you through the process of:
- Containerizing applications using Red Hat Podman.
- Deploying containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Leveraging GitHub for version control.
- Integrating SonarQube into your CI/CD pipeline for code quality and vulnerability analysis.

## Prerequisites
- **Red Hat Podman** installed on your local machine.
- **Minikube** or **OpenShift** installed and configured.
- **GitHub** account for version control and CI/CD.
- **SonarQube** instance (open-source) for code quality checks.
- A sample application for hands-on exercises (a simple Python Flask app ).
